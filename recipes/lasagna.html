    </h1>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, 
        and tender pasta sheets, creating a comforting and satisfying meal. Begin by preparing
         the meat sauce: sauté finely chopped onions and garlic in olive oil until translucent, 
         then add ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and 
         a blend of Italian herbs such as oregano, basil, and thyme. Let the sauce simmer for at 
         least 30 minutes to develop deep flavors. While the sauce simmers, prepare the béchamel 
         sauce by melting butter in a saucepan, adding flour to form a roux, and gradually whisking
          in warm milk until smooth and thickened. Season with a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
          <p>
            To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. 
            Place a layer of pre-cooked lasagna noodles on top, followed by more meat sauce, a layer of
             béchamel, and a generous sprinkle of grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers
              until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of béchamel and cheese. Cover the dish
               with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes, then remove the foil
                and bake for an additional 20 minutes until the top is golden and bubbly. Allow the lasagna to
                 rest for 10 minutes before serving to let the layers set. Enjoy a slice of this hearty lasagna 
                 with a side of garlic bread and a fresh green salad for a complete and satisfying meal.
